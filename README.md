# Medicine_Recommendation_System
This project builds a machine learning-based recommendation system to suggest appropriate medicines based on patient symptoms and historical prescription data.
The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to recommend the most suitable medicines for given symptoms. The system leverages classification algorithms and health-related data to make accurate and helpful predictions.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn
